# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
    prefer_const_constructors: false
    prefer_final_fields: false
    use_key_in_widget_constructors: false
    prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables: false
    prefer_const_constructors_in_immutables: false
    avoid_print: false
    # 这个文件决定了 Flutter 在分析你的代码时应该有多严格。由于这是您第一次涉足 Flutter，
    # 您是在告诉分析器放轻松。您以后可以随时调整它。事实上，当您接近发布实际的生产应用程序时，您几乎肯定希望使分析器比这更严格。
